
public class Objects_Part1 {
/*

instance variables: declared as part of class instead of methods
instance methods: variables declared in methods are local variables 

Difference between class and object?
A class tells the program to make an object of that particular class
An object made from that class had it own values for the class's instance variable

Example:

Class RunnerInfo
The object of class would contain info about one runner of a race

Member methods
public double getSpeedMph(){
}
 - declare within RunnerInfo class
